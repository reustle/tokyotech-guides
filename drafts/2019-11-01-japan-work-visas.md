Japan is notoriously difficult when it comes to obtaining a work visa. If you're looking to stay in the country longer than 6 months per year, which is the current (grey) limit of two 90-day tourist visas, or if you'd like to earn money in Japan, you've got a few options.

<br/><br/>


**Engineer Visa**

- Technically called "Engineer, Humanities, International Services" visa.
- Minimum salary: ¥2,600,000~
- Become a full time employee
- Become a contractor / consultant for a company
- 1, 3, 5 year visas
- bachelors degree or 10 years of experience, only for engineer visa?</p>

<br/><br/>


**Branch Manager Visa**

If you have a foreign entity, you may open up a branch of that company in Japan. This is meant to serve as a research and development location, and you will appoint someone to be stationed in Japan for reserach purposes (i.e., you). There are some caveats, though. You may not earn money from any Japanese companies, so this only really works if you intend to have foreign income only. They also generally don't want the CEO being appointed to Research in the branch, so you'll need to come up with a new position to assign yourself to.

**Investor Visa**

<p>If you would like to be completely self sufficient and not rely on a company to sponsor your visa, but would still like to earn money from Japanese companies, you're best option is to [open a company in Japan (read more)](/docs/opening-a-company-in-japan). The paperwork costs around ¥430,000 to ¥550,000 if you use an external cmopany, and if you plan to sponsor your own visa (likely in this case), you'll need to invest ¥5,000,000 of initial capital into the company. You will need to transfer that money into Japan, but are not strictly required to keep it here once the company has been set up and new visa has been created.

Only 1-year visas for the first 5 years.

Foreign entrepreneurs are required to open a business office and hire two or more permanent employees or have capital/investments exceeding five million yen upon submitting his/her application to the Immigration Bureau in order to receive approval for the “Business Manager” residential status.

The “Startup Visa” system permits foreign entrepreneurs to receive a six-month “Business Manager” visa without fulfilling aforementioned prerequisites.
